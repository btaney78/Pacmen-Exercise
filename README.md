# Pacmen-Exercise

**Description:**  This web page will allow a user to add PacMen to the game frame whenever the 'Add PacMan' button is clicked. When the user clicks the 'Start Game' button, the PacMen will start moving. The user is allowed to continue to add PacMen at any time, even after the PacMen have started moving.

**Instructions on how to run on your machine:**  
To run this program you can do one of two things:
1. Click on this link to run the program:  [PacMen demo](https://btaney78.github.io/Pacmen-Exercise/)
3. Download the following files in this repository: index.html, styles.css, pacmen.js, and all the images in the 'images' folder. Save them locally, and then load the index.html file into an Internet browser (Chrome, etc.).

**Roadmap for future improvements:**
By June 30th:
* Add improved styling to the page
* Add sound when pacmen hit a border
* Add a Clear button to remove all PacMen from game frame
* Add a Pause button to pause PacMen movements when clicked, and then resume movement when clicked again
